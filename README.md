# Redefining PHP's Standard Library: A Focus on Object-Oriented Code

While developing and helping others develop PHP applications I continually noticed the trend to use PHP's arrays to do nearly every task.  Arrays in PHP do practically everything, so it is concievable that you would want to use them.  However, they aren't well suited to object-oriented code.  They aren't objects and you lose the benefits that come with using objects if you stick with arrays.  I concluded that if there was a better library that it might be easier to write good object-oriented code than it currently is.

### Why not use the existing Standard PHP Library?

The current Standard PHP Library (SPL) has many problems, some of which are documented in an [RFC regarding the SPL](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spl-improvements).  I won't go into them here, but I felt I needed to give at least some reasoning for not using it.

### How can I help?

At the moment, I do not really need any help.  I have a small group of people* who I regularly discuss PHP matters with. For now they are all the help that I need. Later on, I will need people to write applications with the new library and give me precious feedback.  I hope you come back to help!
