# Redefining PHP's Standard Library: A Focus on Object-Oriented Code

While developing and helping others develop PHP applications I continually noticed the trend to use PHP's arrays to do nearly every task. Arrays in PHP do practically everything, so they tend to be used for everything. However, they aren't well suited to object-oriented code because they aren't objects. I concluded that if there was a better library that it might be easier to write good object-oriented code than it currently is.

### Why not use the existing Standard PHP Library?

The current Standard PHP Library (SPL) has many problems, some of which are documented in an [RFC regarding the SPL](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spl-improvements).  I won't go into them here, but I felt I needed to give at least some reasoning for not using it.

### Roadmap

There is no roadmap for this project. I work on it when I find something in my daily coding that could benefit this library. A few associates of mine also use this (highly unstable) repository and suggest changes. I intend to release version 1.0.0 when it has been successfully used in multiple projects and can commit to a stable api. Until then, minor versions will be tagged as they are deemed helpful.

### How can I help?

I have a small group of people* who I regularly discuss PHP with. For now they are all the help that I need. Later on, I will need people to write applications with the new library and give me precious feedback.  I hope you come back to help!
