## PHP Datastructures

This project is an attempt to redefine and reimplement the Standard PHP Library (SPL). The current one has many issues, some of which are documented in the [SPL Improvements RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spl-improvements).


<h3>On Hold</h3>

This project is temporarily on hold while some other issues with the SPL are ironed out, because they will affect the data structures.
