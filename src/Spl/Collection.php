 * instead of array. This was a design choice to focus on objects instead of doing what is convenient. You can always
 * pass in an ArrayIterator instead.
 *
 * Note that Collection does not extend Serializable.  This is because all objects can be serialized and unserialized
 * by PHP, and the interface is used only for custom serializing. The final implementations of the data structures in C
 * will extend the Serializable interface.
